# Exporting Sets

Scholarsome does not lock your data to the platform. It's easy to export your set data.

## Exporting to Anki

Navigate to the set within Scholarsome. Click the purple-outlined "export" button on the right hand side of the page, and then click "Anki" in the dropdown menu. After a few seconds, a .apkg file will be downloaded to your browser.

If you have Anki installed on your computer, you can double-click on this file to open it in Anki and begin using it.

## Exporting to Quizlet

:::

Navigate to the set within Scholarsome. Click the purple-outlined "export" button on the right hand side of the page, and then click "Quizlet" in the dropdown menu. A window will open.

In this menu, you must choose the characters that will be used to denote where your cards and sides start and end in the outputted text. The characters you select to use does not matter - all that is important is that the ones that are chosen are not present anywhere within your set's cards. If they are, an error will be thrown. Take note of these characters, as you will need to use them when importing into Quizlet.

After selecting your characters, click the purple "export" button. A .txt file will be downloaded.

To import into Quizlet, click the grey plus in the top right hand corner of your screen, click "study set" in the dropdown menu, and then click "create from scratch." After the page loads, click the button in the middle left of the page with a plus in it that says "import."

In this menu, you will input the characters that you made note of earlier. Click the button that says "custom" underneath the header that says "Between term and definition." Input into this box the character that you typed into the "side discriminator" box in Scholarsome. There will be a second button on this page in Quizlet that is named "custom." Input the other character that you used into this box.

Below these buttons, there will be a preview of the cards that you're about to input. The cards should look the same as they did in Scholarsome, excluding any media.

Click the "import" button. The fields in the Quizlet creation page will now be filled with your set data from Scholarsome. You can now create your Quizlet set as normal.
